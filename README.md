A very simple Python script for converting presentations created with
[showoff][1] for use with [Deckset][2]. 

As I only have a couple of my own presentations for testing, there will
probably be bugs with yours. In particular, all transitions will be
stripped and any custom CSS not used. Also, you might check out the
TODO file for known open issues.
